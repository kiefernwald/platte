# Platte

Platte is a small command line tool that combines static HTML pages from modules.

## Installation

Platte requires ruby. To install, run:

`bundle install`

## Usage

The main script to be used is `platte` in the main folder. It has a single command, called `combine` which lets you combine a main-module (usually the surrounding HTML structure with placeholders for resources) and other modules.

All modules you define must be placed in the `modules` folder. Main modules names end with `.main`, other modules names end with `.module`.

## Module structure
